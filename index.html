  <p>There have been many attempts to define what weather is over the years. the most common
    definitions are usually:-
  </p>

  <p><b>Weather</b> is the day-to-day or hour-to-hour change in the atmosphere. Weather includes wind, lightning,
    storms, hurricanes, tornedos, rain, hail, snow. -etc-</p>
    <p><b>Weather</b> is the state of atmosphere, describing for example, the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.</p>

  <p>Climate tells us what kind of weather usually happen in an area at different times of the year.</p>

  <p>Energy from the sun affects the weather.</p>

  <p>Changes in weather can affect our mood and life.
    We wear different clothes and do different things in different weather conditions.
    We choose differnet foods and drinks in different seasons, like ice cream in the summer, nut and berries
    in the autmn, or hot chocolate in the winter.</p>

  <p>Weather is measured in weather stations around the world. Ways to measure weather include:
    weather speed,
    wind direction,
    temperature,
    barometric pressure,
    humidity.
  </p>

  <p>People try to use this measurements to make weather forecasts for the future. This people are Scientists, called <b>metreologists</b>. They use computers to build large mathematical models to follow weather trend.</p>

  <p>Severe weather can hurt people and their property. It can also just be a bother. Some examples of Severe
    weather are:-
  <ol>
    <li>Tropical cyclones</li>
    <li>Rainstorms</li>
    <li>Drought</li>
    <li>Heat waves</li>
    <li>Frost</li>
    <li>Fog</li>
    <li>Tornedos</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>The weather patterns have been changing over the years due to both natural and human activities all over
    the
    world.</p>

  <p>Weather happens because different parts of the earth get different amounts of heat from the sun.
    This makes different climates. The tropics get the most heat because the sun shines straight down on them,
    while the poles get the least heat because the sun shines on them from a low angle.</p>

  <p>Warmer air is lighter than cooler air and rises higher in the sky by convection.</p>

  <p>Human activities contribute to climate change by causing changes in earth's atmosphere in the amounts of greenhouse
    gasses,
    aerosols (small particles) and cloudiness.</p>

  <p>Human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, are altering the climate system.</p>

  <p>Human-driven changes in land use and land cover such as deforestation, urbanization, and shifts in
    vegetation patterns also alters the climate, resulting in changes to the reflectivity of the earth surface (albedo),
    emissions from burning forests, urban heat island effects and changes in the natural water cycle.</p>

  <p>Because the primary cause of recent global climate changes is human, the solution are also within the human domain.
    It is until we change our 'bad habits', that we will be able to restore mother-nature to its original state. Each and every 
    individual has a role to play, be it watering plants, proper disposal of waste and gabbage, using environment friendly 
    methodoloogies to curb the wear and tear of our ozone layer.
  </p>

  <p>Because we understand the causes of climate change, that paves a way for effective solutions to be developed and
    deployed</p>
